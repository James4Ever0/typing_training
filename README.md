Train your typing skill with a single Python script!

## Demo

## Motivation

This script will display a bunch of random characters, and you need to type them in the exact order each turn. When finished, you press `Enter` to continue.

To reach full proficiency, you need to memorize the locations of every keystroke, without looking at the keyboard.

You can use this script to familarize new keyboard layouts, such as splitable keyboards, and miniature keyboards.

## Platform

Linux only currently.
